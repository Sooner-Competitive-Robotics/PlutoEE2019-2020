## Electrical Team Projects
Our stuff needs to **_git gud_**

## PCBs

### Arduino Breakout Board (Control)
Designed to house an arduino nano and connect it to the the an IMU, motor controller, and  motor encoders. It will have the following functions.

* The board will have the arduino nano with it routed to the BNO-055 IMU that will give back orientation data of the robot. 
* The arduino nano will also send data to the LN293 motor controller. 
* It will also recieve data from the motor encoders
### Sensor Board 
Designed to house an arduino nano and connect it to an IMU and multiple ultrasonic sensors. It will have the following functions.

* The board will have the arduino nano with it routed to the MPU 9250 IMU that will give back magnatometer data to detect a magnetic field. 
* The arduino nano will also recieve data from the three ultrasonic senors. 
### Power Module
Designed to house a buck converter and a fuse holder 

* the buck converter that will be used is LM2596
## Parts 
Eventually add some things
